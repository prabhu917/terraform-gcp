# Project Progress Summary

This document summarizes the work accomplished on setting up GCP resources using Terraform and outlines the remaining tasks.

## Accomplished Tasks:

We have successfully set up the foundational Terraform structure and defined resources for the following GCP services:

1.  **Initial Terraform Setup:** Created core configuration files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `terraform.tfvars.example`, `README.md`).
2.  **GCS Bucket:** Defined a Google Cloud Storage bucket with versioning and lifecycle rules.
3.  **Cloud SQL:** Configured a Cloud SQL instance (PostgreSQL), database, and user. Debugged and resolved configuration issues.
4.  **BigQuery Dataset:** Added a BigQuery dataset resource.
5.  **Dataproc Cluster:** Defined a Dataproc cluster, configured to use the GCS bucket for staging.
6.  **Security & `.cursorignore`:** Created a `.cursorignore` file to prevent sensitive files and Terraform state from being tracked.
7.  **Modularization:** Refactored the configuration into reusable modules for GCS, Cloud SQL, BigQuery, and Dataproc, improving organization and maintainability.
8.  **IAM and Service Account:** Created a dedicated IAM module to provision a service account with specific, limited permissions (GCS read/manage, BigQuery write, Dataproc Worker) for the Dataproc cluster.
9.  **Module Integration:** Integrated the new IAM module and updated the Dataproc module to use the dedicated service account.
10. **Outputs:** Created an `outputs.tf` file in the root to easily retrieve resource details after deployment.

## Remaining Tasks:

To complete the deployment and verify the setup, please perform the following steps in your terminal from the project root directory:

1.  **Verify `terraform.tfvars`:** Ensure your `terraform.tfvars` file contains accurate values for all variables.
2.  **Place Service Account Key:** Confirm your service account JSON key is in the `key/` directory and the path in `terraform.tfvars` is correct.
3.  **Run `terraform init`:** Initialize the Terraform working directory to download providers and modules:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
4.  **Run `terraform plan`:** Review the execution plan before applying changes:
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
    Carefully examine the output for any errors or unexpected changes.
5.  **Run `terraform apply`:** Apply the configuration to create the resources in GCP:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
    Type `yes` when prompted.

Once `terraform apply` is successful, you can use `terraform output` to retrieve the details of the deployed resources.
