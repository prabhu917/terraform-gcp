# Project Progress Summary

This document summarizes the work accomplished on setting up GCP resources using Terraform and outlines the remaining tasks.

## Accomplished Tasks:

We have successfully:

1.  Initialized the core Terraform project structure and files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `terraform.tfvars.example`, `README.md`).
2.  Set up a basic configuration for deploying a GCS bucket.
3.  Created a `.cursorignore` file to manage ignored files for the Cursor IDE.
4.  Handled the sensitive `terraform.tfvars` file by ensuring it's ignored and creating an example template.
5.  Added resources and variables for a Cloud SQL instance, database, and user.
6.  Debugged and corrected configuration issues related to Cloud SQL, including `tier` placement and the `host` argument for PostgreSQL users.
7.  Reviewed the initial configuration files.
8.  Added resources and variables for a BigQuery dataset.
9.  Added resources and variables for a Dataproc cluster, configuring it to use the GCS bucket for staging.
10. Created a root `outputs.tf` file and added output variables for key deployed resources.
11. Modularized the configuration by creating separate modules for GCS, Cloud SQL, BigQuery, and Dataproc.
12. Updated the root `main.tf` to call these modules and pass necessary variables.
13. Updated the root `outputs.tf` to collect outputs from the modules and organized them for clarity.
14. Created an `iam` module to manage service account creation and IAM bindings.
15. Defined a service account resource within the `iam` module.
16. Added specific IAM roles to the service account using dynamic bindings based on a variable list.
17. Configured the Dataproc module to utilize the dedicated service account created by the `iam` module.
18. Made the service account details (ID, display name, roles) configurable via variables in the root and passed to the `iam` module.
19. Provided `terraform import` commands for importing existing GCS bucket, BigQuery dataset, and Service Account resources into the state.
20. Set up a remote state backend using the created GCS bucket and a specified prefix, moving the state from local to remote.
21. Discussed best practices for using remote backends, including state locking and versioning.
22. Explained the difference between Git versioning and state file versioning.
23. Confirmed that object versioning was enabled on the GCS state bucket via the code.
24. Demonstrated and performed a state rollback to a previous version stored in GCS.
25. Configured the `.gitignore` file with comprehensive patterns to prevent sensitive files and artifacts from being committed to Git.
26. Created the `terraform.tfvars.example` file as a safe template for sensitive configurations.
27. Verified that the files intended for Git commit do not contain hardcoded sensitive data, especially within the modules.

## Remaining Tasks:

To complete the deployment and verify the setup, please perform the following steps in your terminal from the project root directory:

1.  **Verify `terraform.tfvars`:** Ensure your `terraform.tfvars` file contains accurate values for all variables.
2.  **Place Service Account Key:** Confirm your service account JSON key is in the `key/` directory and the path in `terraform.tfvars` is correct.
3.  **Run `terraform init`:** Initialize the Terraform working directory to download providers and modules:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
4.  **Run `terraform plan`:** Review the execution plan before applying changes:
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
    Carefully examine the output for any errors or unexpected changes.
5.  **Run `terraform apply`:** Apply the configuration to create the resources in GCP:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
    Type `yes` when prompted.

Once `terraform apply` is successful, you can use `terraform output` to retrieve the details of the deployed resources.
